Learning Socket Programming in Java
I have made a Two Way Communication Application using Java. It was very Interesting because here I have learned about java.net Packages, java.io Packages. There were many concepts of which I was not aware of were there. Here I have implemented TCP Connection between Server and Client.



Concept Used in This Are:

✅ Java Basics

✅ Java Input Output 

✅ Java Networking 

✅ Socket Programming 

✅ Computer Networks

✅ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)


I was not aware that Strings are not compared with '==' in java, here is a  concept of .equals() method of which I was not aware. So I have learned it.
